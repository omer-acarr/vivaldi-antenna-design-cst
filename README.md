# 30-60 GHz Wideband Vivaldi Antenna Design

This repository contains the design, modeling, and simulation results of a wideband Vivaldi antenna, developed using CST Studio Suite 2025. The design is optimized for mmWave (millimeter-wave) frequency bands, specifically targeting high-performance communication systems.

## Technical Overview
The antenna is designed on a substrate with a dielectric constant of 4.1 and a thickness of 0.2 mm. The design utilizes exponential tapering to achieve wideband impedance matching across the 30-60 GHz spectrum.

### Key Parameters
The design is fully parameterized to allow for easy optimization:
* **subw (Substrate Width):** 3 mm
* **sL (Slot Length):** 1 mm
* **h (Substrate Thickness):** 0.2 mm
* **k (Dielectric Constant):** 4.1
* **Frequency Range:** 30 GHz to 60 GHz
